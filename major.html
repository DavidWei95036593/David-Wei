<div class="description">
This major combines the basic courses of the general linguistics program with that of computer science, accommodating students who want professional preparation in computer science but do not necessarily have a strong interest in computer systems hardware. The goal of linguistics is the enrichment of knowledge about the nature, grammar, and history of human language. Linguistics is a theoretical discipline, akin to philosophy, anthropology, and cognitive psychology.

The undergraduate major in Political Science aims to provide understanding of basic political processes and institutions as these operate in different national and cultural contexts. It also covers the interaction between national states, the changing character of the relations between citizens and governments, and the values and criteria by which the quality of political life is judged. The program may be individually focused to serve the needs of the liberal arts major, the student seeking preparation for graduate work in political science, public administration, law, and other professional fields, and the student preparing for specialized roles in political and public organizations.The undergraduate major in Political Science aims to provide understanding of basic political processes and institutions as these operate in different national and cultural contexts.
